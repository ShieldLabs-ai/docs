# ShieldLabs Documentation

ShieldLabs detects risky traffic (VPN/Proxy/Tor, anti-detect browsers, automation, multi-accounting) using network, device, and behavior signals. Every request receives a Trust Score (0–100) with reasons and an action recommendation: allow, challenge (2FA), or block.

Why ShieldLabs
- Stable Device ID with multi-layer verification
- IP & network intelligence beyond static lists (ASN/ISP, VPN/Proxy/Tor, geo & route anomalies)
- Behavior analytics (velocity across IPs/devices/accounts, repeated patterns)
- Actionable scoring, webhooks, and a clear dashboard
